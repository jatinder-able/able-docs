## Badging

Badges represent an award, a certificate, an endorsement or an authorization. On Sunbird, there are two types of badges: <br>1. Badges for Content <br>2. Badges for People

Badges are awarded to people to recognize their skills or accomplishments. They are awarded to content pieces as a certicate of authority or recommendation. They also help organize and search content.  

#### Badges for People

Organizations can assign badges to users who:
<br>1. Complete prescribed courses <br>2. Use Sunbird in classrooms for the prescribed or greater duration <br>3. Create content that is highly consumed <br>4. Recieve awards and certificates offline

**Note** For details on how to issue badges to users, refer [Issuing Badges to Users](/assets/badging_framework/badges_users/#Issuing-Badges-to-Users)

#### Badges for Content
Organizations assign badges to content to:
<br>1. Create authorized content
Organizations can create content on Sunbird and mark them with appropriate badges such as , Official.
During search or navigation, badged content is displayed in the top results
<br>2. Create special content
Organizations can create content for specific use cases such as, content for special needs, specific age
groups etc. Badging such content aids their discoverability
<br>3. Endorse content
Organizations can assign badges such as Popular, Recommended etc., to endorse and increase the
usability of content created and uploaded

Currently, on Sunbird, content badges can be assigned only to textbooks.


### Issuing Badges for Content
Badging plays a critical role in the creation and curation of content and courses. Badging content is primarily useful in
organizing, searching and recommending suitable content. It enables increased content usage. Organization administrators, on Sunbird, can create and assign badges to content. Organizations can create any badge titles such as Popular, Recommended etc. For more details on creating badges, refer Creating Badges.

In this documentation, for the pupose of explaining the process of issuing badges to content we have used the example of a badge, titled, Official.
